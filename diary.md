# Week 2

## Week 2.2

I complete the proof of concept program for a simple decision tree, 
using references and class nodes. I have started adapting the tree to
the expectimax algorithm. I have created a maximum node which can get the score
of its largest child. I used JUnit and the IntelliJ debug tools to find why the
score of a maximizing node was always zero.


## Week 2.1

This week I have finished of my project plan and my planned reading for the 
project so far. I have also made some progress on the prototype for a 
decision tree. It is currently able to make a decision tree with basic layout. 
Nodes are currently not able to store score and edges are not weighted.

# Week 1

This week I have only done two major things

* Firstly I have worked on my project plan ensuring that I know what to do over the project as well as what could go wrong.
* Secondly I have worked on reading sources relating to my project. These include previous attempts to solve 2048 with the
  expectimax algorithm as well as some material on the expetimax algorithm.
