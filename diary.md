# Week 1
This week I have only done two major things
	- Firsly I have worked on my project plan ensuring that I know what to do over the project as well as what could go wrong.
	- Secondly I have worked on reading sources relating to my project. These include previous attempts to solve 2048 with the
	  expectimax algorithm as well as some material on the expeti-max alogrithm.
