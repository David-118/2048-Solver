# Week 2
This week I have finished of my project plan and my planned reading for the project so far.
I have also made some progress on the prototype for a decision tree. It is currently able to make a decision tree
with basic layout. Nodes are currently not able to store score and edges are not weighted.

# Week 1
This week I have only done two major things
	* Firstly I have worked on my project plan ensuring that I know what to do over the project as well as what could go wrong.
	* Secondly I have worked on reading sources relating to my project. These include previous attempts to solve 2048 with the
	  expectimax algorithm as well as some material on the expetimax algorithm.
